# electron-next-boiler

This is a minimal Electron application based on this [Repository](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start). To get more detail, read this [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

## How To

- clone this repository
- cd into it and run `yarn`
- run `yarn start` to run the app in dev mode
- run `yarn dist` to build the app for your current platform

## What's inside

- next.js renderer setup (like you know it from next)
- react 16 and es6 support with babel
- nice dev workflow with HMR (live code pushing into the app on save)
- styled-jsx support for a styling solution that also works in the production build of the app
- a nice project structure done with alias definitions in babel and webpack (see next.config.js)
